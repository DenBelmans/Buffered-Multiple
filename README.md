# Buffered-Multiple
A 2HP buffered Multiple in Eurorack format. 2x3 or 1x6 configurations possible.

***** Build Instructions *****

1) Start off by placing the right-angled headers in the PCB that will house the thonkiconns. Place their straight leads through the holes and cut them off flush with the PCB. Take them out again and cut them off a little more so that you can solder them flush to the board without any stubs sticking out. Solder them.
2) Place all thonkiconns on the board, place the front panel on and fasten the nuts. Then flip over the assembly and solder the jacks in place.
3) Take the smaller pcb and solder all resistors, diodes, capacitors and ferrite beads. Make sure you solder the electrolytic capacitors as flush as possible or if you are using caps that are taller than 5mm solder them with their bodies flat on the PCB.
4) Solder the IC's directly to the board. There is no room for sockets!
5) Place the second board on the right angled connectors so that the second board tilted a bit down (towards the side that has no components. Make sure you stay within the 2HP width!
6) Solder the 1x5 right angled power connector. I left room for a 2x5 connector but these were a little tall. I used the rowo furthest away from the edge. Solder it so that, when connected, the power connector is within the 2HP width.

That should be all. If you encounter any problems or have questions, feel free to contact me via e-mail: belmansander@gmail.com
