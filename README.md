# Buffered-Multiple
A 2HP buffered Multiple in Eurorack format. 2x3 or 1x6 configurations possible.

The build process is a little tight but it worked out well. Make sure you align the perpendicular PCB well with the top PCB to keep within the 2HP format. IC's should be soldered directly without sockets to keep a low profile. Also use shallow 10uF capacitors or put them parallel to the PCB.

Clearer instructions and a BOM will be added soon!
